## Problem Statement

`“TIMON AND PUMBA ” have started their third startup “HAKUNA
MATATA” which provides food delivery service in Jamshedpur .
However since it is in early stage , it needs to save cost in every
fields . They found that maximum orders are from NIT
JAMSHEDPUR . Since all the hotels in Bistupur are located within a
radius of 2 km , it still assigns every order to a different delivery boy
delivering to students within a radius of 500 m . The company also
has limited delivery boys which leads to the problem “ Restaurant
not accepting orders ” due to unavailability of any delivery boy at
that particular moment . Since the company didn’t want to hire any
additional delivery boy and at the same time it didn’t want to lose it’s
customers also , so can u help them to develop an application which
can help them to optimise their cost. The company now operates in
four regions .`  
`a) LD1 - Bistupur`  
`b) LD2 - Adityapur`  
`c) LD3 - Sakchi`  
`d) LD4 - Kadma`  
`And the distance between the following regions are as follows:`  
`LD1 - LD2 = 5km , LD1 - LD3 = 3km , LD1 - LD4 = 6km`
